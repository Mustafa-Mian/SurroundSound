**The Vision**

I want to create SurroundSound for 2 reasons:
1. No matter where I study, it feels like there are constant distractions. People talking, music, and even general outdoor ambience can get loud and prevent me from getting work done. I wondered if I could somehow keep track of all the distractions - Like listing which ones are more common, how many times they show up, and judging if an area is good for studying in general. SurroundSound is my solution to this (hopefully).
2. I wanted to make a Swift iOS app.

I hope that this project evolves to fufill these requirements. If you are somehow reading this, let me know, did I succeed?
